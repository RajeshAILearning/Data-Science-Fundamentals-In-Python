We can quickly find patterns in the visual information we encounter`, which was incredibly important from a survivability standpoint. Unfortunately, when data is represented as tables of values, we can't really take advantage of our visual pattern matching capabilities. This is because our ability to quickly process symbolic values (like numbers and words) is very poor. **Data visualization focuses on transforming data from table representations visual ones**."
